The movie's reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur).

The initial experiment is successful and the two exchange minds. But trouble ensues when Zyto refuses to reverse the switch. There is little Marc can do when Zyto takes over Marc's life, and more ominously his wife and child whom are unknowingly in mortal danger. Marc, encased in Zyto's body, is returned to the asylum.

Anthony Hopkins is the conservative industrialist Henry Wilcox and Vanessa Redgrave is his ailing wife Ruth Wilcox.",10.854598,/oD61psGoSAZHxnX0xXZ8x6nNuqG.jpg,"[{'name': 'Merchant Ivory Productions', 'id': 2370}, {'name': 'The Criterion Collection', 'id': 10932}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'GB', 'name': 'United Kingdom'}]",1992-03-13,25966555,140.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}, {'iso_639_1': 'de', 'name': 'Deutsch'}]",Released,,Howards End,False,7.0,98
