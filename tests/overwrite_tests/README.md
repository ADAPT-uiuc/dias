Here I have tests for the cases where we overwrite a pandas function (e.g., `apply()`) and we don't rewrite externally. For now, we can't test these with the same infrastructure
because the main rewriting routine does not know the cell is modified internally (and so, we can't set the `modified` field in JSON). So, currently these tests are only observational
(i.e., we just test that the rewritten and the original version have the same output) and we don't test the rewritten code.
